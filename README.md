# SOLIDitech and Aruba Hackathon 2020

COVID-19 has created many problems for many businesses. Create a unique, useful solution to one of these problems

## problem?

- covid-19 has forced many businesses to adapt to remote work

- a large % of remote employees don't put in the hours they are paid for

- offices were an average solution, because in an office managers can see if someone is **actually** working (not a perfect solution, lots of people sit in an office do nothing productive)

- infeasible to monitor remote workers all day

### ultimately, the problem is:
### can one make a system that allows managers to incentivise productive work?

## solution

the solution is X, an outcome based productivity tool for teams
